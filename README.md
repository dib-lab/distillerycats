# distillerycats
Distill sourmash with spacegraphcats.
For metaanalysis of metagenomic datasets.
Currently takes as input metagenome sequencing reads from multiple studies, the study from which each sample originated, and a classification variable of interest. 
The code supports regression tasks as well, but not all steps of the pipeline have been tested for regression. 

This repository is under active development. 
The code in the master branch is not guarunteed to be completely documented or functional yet. 
We plan to remove this message soon when this is no longer true :)
